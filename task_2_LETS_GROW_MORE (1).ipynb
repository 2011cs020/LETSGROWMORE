        "To Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him\n",
        "mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\n",
        "predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion\n",
        "akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,\n",
        "were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He\n",
        "was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\n",
        "the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\n",
        "false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\n",
        "and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for\n",
        "drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained\n",
        "reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\n",
        "adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\n",
        "throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\n",
        "instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\n",
        "be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And\n",
        "yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\n",
        "Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\n",
        "from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\n",
        "interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\n",
        "of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\n",
        "while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian\n",
        "soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\n",
        "books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\n",
        "the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\n",
        "nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\n",
        "and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\n",
        "observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\n",
        "mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\n",
        "From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\n",
        "summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\n",
        "of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\n",
        "finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\n",
        "successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\n",
        "his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\n",
        "the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\n",
        "\n",
        "One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a\n",
        "journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\n",
        "my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\n",
        "door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\n",
        "with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\n",
        "keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\n",
        "extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\n",
        "looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\n",
        "against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\n",
        "head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\n",
        "knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\n",
        "story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created\n",
        "dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell\n",
        "and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\n",
        "\n",
        "His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\n",
        "to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\n",
        "me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\n",
        "spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\n",
        "and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put\n",
        "on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Seven!” I answered.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\n",
        "fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\n",
        "that you intended to go into harness.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then, how do you know?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\n",
        "yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\n",
        "servant girl?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have\n",
        "been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a\n",
        "country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\n",
        "have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\n",
        "Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\n",
        "again, I fail to see how you work it out.”\n",
        "\n",
        "He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside\n",
        "of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\n",
        "scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\n",
        "someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\n",
        "order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double\n",
        "deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\n",
        "particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As\n",
        "to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\n",
        "iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\n",
        "forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\n",
        "he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\n",
        "pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\n",
        "process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,\n",
        "“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\n",
        "could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\n",
        "reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I\n",
        "believe that my eyes are as good as yours.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\n",
        "down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The\n",
        "distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\n",
        "which lead up from the hall to this room.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Frequently.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“How often?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, some hundreds of times.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then how many are there?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“How many? I don’t know.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\n",
        "my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\n",
        "both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these\n",
        "little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\n",
        "of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw\n",
        "over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\n",
        "upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The note was undated, and without either signature or address.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it\n",
        "said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\n",
        "deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\n",
        "Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\n",
        "matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\n",
        "This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\n",
        "chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\n",
        "wear a mask.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it\n",
        "means?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\n",
        "data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\n",
        "theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\n",
        "it?”\n",
        "\n",
        "I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\n",
        "written.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\n",
        "endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not\n",
        "be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\n",
        "stiff.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English\n",
        "paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G”\n",
        "with a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’\n",
        "which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like\n",
        "our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us\n",
        "glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume\n",
        "from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a\n",
        "German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable\n",
        "as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\n",
        "glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\n",
        "that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\n",
        "from his cigarette.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\n",
        "peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from\n",
        "all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written\n",
        "that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\n",
        "remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who\n",
        "writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\n",
        "face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\n",
        "doubts.”\n",
        "\n",
        "As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating\n",
        "wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\n",
        "whistled.\n",
        "\n",
        "“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of\n",
        "the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\n",
        "and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there\n",
        "is nothing else.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.\n",
        "And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But your client—”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.\n",
        "Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.”\n",
        "\n",
        "A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\n",
        "passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\n",
        "authoritative tap.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Come in!” said Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\n",
        "in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich\n",
        "with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\n",
        "taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\n",
        "fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\n",
        "thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and\n",
        "secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\n",
        "beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were\n",
        "trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\n",
        "barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He\n",
        "carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\n",
        "part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\n",
        "mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\n",
        "was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face\n",
        "he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\n",
        "and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length\n",
        "of obstinacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\n",
        "marked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from\n",
        "one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr.\n",
        "Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\n",
        "have I the honour to address?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\n",
        "understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\n",
        "discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\n",
        "importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you\n",
        "alone.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\n",
        "my chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this\n",
        "gentleman anything which you may say to me.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he,\n",
        "“by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\n",
        "that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too\n",
        "much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\n",
        "European history.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I promise,” said Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“And I.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The august\n",
        "person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may\n",
        "confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\n",
        "not exactly my own.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to\n",
        "be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\n",
        "seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak\n",
        "plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\n",
        "kings of Bohemia.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\n",
        "his armchair and closing his eyes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\n",
        "lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the\n",
        "most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\n",
        "slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\n",
        "\n",
        "“If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I\n",
        "should be better able to advise you.”\n",

        "the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,\n",
        "and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could\n",
        "open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\n",

        "out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom\n",
        "goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male\n",
        "visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,\n",

        "his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably\n",
        "transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less\n",
        "likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should\n",
        "continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the\n",
        "gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it\n",

        "I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman\n",

        "appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the\n",

        "we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming\n",
        "of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from\n",
        "Sherlock Holmes’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be\n",
        "less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a\n",
        "quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of\n",
        "shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a\n",
        "scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a\n",

        "down with cigars in their mouths.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\n",
        "house, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes\n",
        "a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse\n",
        "to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming\n",
        "to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find\n",
        "the photograph?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Where, indeed?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet\n",
        "size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows\n",
        "that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two\n",
        "attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that\n",
        "she does not carry it about with her.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Where, then?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am\n",
        "inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like\n",
        "to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?\n",
        "She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what\n",
        "indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a\n",
        "business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within\n",
        "a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be\n",
        "in her own house.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But it has twice been burgled.”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the\n",
        "curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to\n",
        "the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at\n",
        "the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a\n",
        "copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with\n",
        "the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by\n",
        "the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the\n",
        "scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was\n",
        "struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,\n",
        "was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\n",
        "struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes\n",
        "dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,\n",
        "he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely\n",
        "down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one\n",
        "direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better\n",
        "dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\n",
        "crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene\n",
        "Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she\n",
        "stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\n",
        "the hall, looking back into the street.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“He is dead,” cried several voices.\n",
        "\n",
        "“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be gone\n",
        "before you can get him to hospital.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had the lady’s\n",
        "purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a\n",
        "rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.\n",
        "This way, please!”\n",
        "\n",
        "Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\n",
        "principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by\n",
        "the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,\n",
        "so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know\n",
        "whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he\n",
        "was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of\n",
        "myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I\n",
        "was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon\n",
        "the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes\n",
        "to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened\n",
        "my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I\n",
        "thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from\n",
        "injuring another.\n",
        "\n",
        "Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who\n",
        "is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At\n",
        "the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my\n",
        "rocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out\n",
        "of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\n",
        "ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of\n",
        "“Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the\n",
        "open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later\n",
        "the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false\n",
        "alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\n",
        "of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm\n",
        "in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly\n",
        "and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the\n",
        "quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been\n",
        "better. It is all right.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You have the photograph?”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“And how did you find out?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“She showed me, as I told you she would.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am still in the dark.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was\n",
        "perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was\n",
        "an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I guessed as much.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the\n",
        "palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my\n",
        "face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That also I could fathom.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\n",
        "she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\n",
        "suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to\n",
        "see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were\n",
        "compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“How did that help you?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,\n",
        "her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It\n",
        "is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\n",
        "advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it\n",
        "was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married\n",
        "woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.\n",
        "Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\n",
        "more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to\n",
        "secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting\n",
        "were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\n",
        "photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\n",
        "bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as\n",
        "she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\n",
        "replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have\n",
        "not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the\n",
        "house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;\n",
        "but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it\n",
        "seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And now?” I asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King\n",
        "to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown\n",
        "into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that\n",
        "when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be\n",
        "a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And when will you call?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a\n",
        "clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a\n",
        "complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without\n",
        "delay.”\n",

        "\n",
        "There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\n",

        "\n",
        "“I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit\n",

        "\n",
        "“It is true. And yet—! Well! I wish she had been of my own station!\n",
        "What a queen she would have made!” He relapsed into a moody silence,\n",
        "which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\n",
        "\n",
        "The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the\n",

        "plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The\n",
        "photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was\n",
        "superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.” My\n",
        "friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at\n",

        "\n",
        "    “MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well. You took\n",
        "    me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a\n",
        "    suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I\n",
        "    began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had\n",
        "    been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly\n",
        "    be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you\n",
        "    made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\n",
        "    suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old\n",
        "    clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.\n",
        "    Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the\n",
        "    freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,\n",
        "    ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came\n",
        "    down just as you departed.\n",
        "\n",

        "to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon\n",
        "the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we\n",
        "wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmes as\n",
        "his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.\n",

        "\n",
        "“There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a\n",

        "redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up,\n",
        "and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would\n",
        "disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy\n",
        "matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much\n",
        "more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door\n",
        "as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to\n",

        "“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘He has every\n",

        "took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair\n",
        "until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my\n",
        "hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘You will, however, I am\n",
        "sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’ With that he seized\n",
        "my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.\n",
        "‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he as he released me. ‘I perceive\n",
        "that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have\n",
        "twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales\n",
        "of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ He stepped\n",
        "over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that\n",
        "the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,\n",
        "and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was\n",
        "not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\n",

        "\n",

        "ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of\n",
        "the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such\n",

        "there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out\n",
        "like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that\n",
        "he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly\n",

        "place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out\n",
        "into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few\n",
        "clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden\n",
        "and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with\n",
        "“JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the\n",
        "place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock\n",
        "Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it\n",
        "all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he\n",
        "walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still\n",
        "looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s,\n",
        "and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or\n",
        "three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly\n",
        "opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to\n",
        "step in.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “He is, in my\n",

        "\n",
        "The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from\n",
        "the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as\n",
        "the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main\n",
        "arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west.\n",
        "The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in\n",
        "a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with\n",
        "the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we\n",
        "looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that\n",
        "they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant\n",

        "It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is\n",
        "Mortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg\n",
        "branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and\n",
        "McFarlane’s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the\n",

        "ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his\n",
        "singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his\n",
        "extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought,\n",
        "the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\n",
        "occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from\n",

        "so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in\n",
        "his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.\n",
        "Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,\n",
        "and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of\n",
        "intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would\n",
        "look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other\n",
        "mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St.\n",

        "seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not\n",
        "only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the\n",
        "whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my\n",

        "that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a\n",
        "man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it\n",

        "the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in\n",
        "animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter\n",
        "Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin,\n",

        "\n",

        "but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say\n",
        "that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the\n",

        "will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be\n",
        "some £ 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you\n",

        "\n",
        "“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young man,\n",
        "Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would\n",
        "rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a\n",
        "remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke,\n",
        "and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as\n",
        "his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never\n",
        "know where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one\n",
        "week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.\n",

        "“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I’ve\n",
        "had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with\n",
        "you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however,\n",

        "Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and\n",
        "lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the\n",
        "afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets\n",
        "until we emerged into Farrington Street.\n",
        "\n",
        "“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather\n",
        "is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought\n",
        "it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though\n",
        "an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He\n",
        "is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his\n",
        "claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”\n",
        "\n",
        "We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found\n",
        "ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the\n",
        "guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and\n",
        "through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small\n",
        "corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was\n",
        "opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated\n",
        "at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a\n",
        "lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and\n",
        "so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was\n",
        "piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked as he held up\n",
        "the lantern and gazed about him.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the\n",
        "flags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he\n",
        "remarked, looking up in surprise.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmes\n",
        "severely. “You have already imperilled the whole success of our\n",
        "expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down\n",
        "upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?”\n",
        "\n",
        "The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very\n",
        "injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon\n",
        "the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine\n",
        "minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to\n",
        "satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his\n",
        "pocket.\n",
        "\n",
        "“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they can hardly\n",
        "take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they\n",
        "will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer\n",
        "time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no\n",
        "doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the\n",
        "principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors,\n",
        "and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring\n",
        "criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar\n",
        "at present.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several\n",
        "warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Your French gold?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and\n",
        "borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It\n",
        "has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money,\n",
        "and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit\n",
        "contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our\n",
        "reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a\n",
        "single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the\n",
        "subject.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time\n",
        "that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters\n",
        "will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the\n",
        "screen over that dark lantern.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And sit in the dark?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I\n",
        "thought that, as we were a _partie carrée_, you might have your rubber\n",
        "after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far\n",
        "that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must\n",
        "choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take\n",
        "them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.\n",
        "I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind\n",
        "those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they\n",
        "fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind\n",
        "which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern\n",
        "and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never\n",
        "before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that\n",
        "the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To\n",
        "me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was\n",
        "something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold\n",
        "dank air of the vault.\n",
        "\n",
        "“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through\n",
        "the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I\n",
        "asked you, Jones?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and\n",
        "wait.”\n",
        "\n",
        "What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an\n",
        "hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have\n",
        "almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and\n",
        "stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up\n",
        "to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I\n",
        "could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could\n",
        "distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the\n",
        "thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look\n",
        "over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught\n",
        "the glint of a light.\n",
        "\n",
        "At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it\n",
        "lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any\n",
        "warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white,\n",
        "almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area\n",
        "of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,\n",
        "protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it\n",
        "appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which\n",
        "marked a chink between the stones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing\n",
        "sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and\n",
        "left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a\n",
        "lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which\n",
        "looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the\n",
        "aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee\n",
        "rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the\n",
        "hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like\n",
        "himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags?\n",
        "Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”\n",
        "\n",
        "Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.\n",
        "The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth\n",
        "as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a\n",
        "revolver, but Holmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and\n",
        "the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You have no chance at\n",
        "all.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that\n",
        "my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must\n",
        "compliment you.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and\n",
        "effective.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at\n",
        "climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our\n",
        "prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not be\n",
        "aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also,\n",
        "when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”\n",
        "\n",
        "“All right,” said Jones with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you\n",
        "please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your\n",
        "Highness to the police-station?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That is better,” said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to\n",
        "the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from\n",
        "the cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.\n",
        "There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most\n",
        "complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery\n",
        "that have ever come within my experience.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John\n",
        "Clay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this\n",
        "matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am\n",
        "amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,\n",
        "and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning as we\n",
        "sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it was perfectly\n",
        "obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather\n",
        "fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying\n",
        "of the _Encyclopædia_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker\n",
        "out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of\n",

        "could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure\n",
        "as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What\n",

        "his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end\n",
        "of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious\n",
        "assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most\n",
        "daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the\n",
        "cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What\n",

        "was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant\n",
        "answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes\n",
        "upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were\n",
        "what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn,\n",
        "wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of\n",

        "up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a\n",
        "teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was\n",
        "that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking\n",
        "out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will\n",
        "allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the\n",

        "woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red\n",
        "feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess\n",
        "of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she\n",
        "peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her\n",
        "body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her\n",
        "glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves\n",
        "the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of\n",
        "the bell.\n",
        "\n",

        "_affaire de cœur_. She would like advice, but is not sure that the\n",
        "matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may\n",
        "discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no\n",
        "longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we\n",
        "may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so\n",

        "pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for\n",
        "which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into\n",

        "me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank—that is, my\n",
        "father—took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go\n",
        "to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that\n",
        "there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things\n",
        "and came right away to you.”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too,\n",

        "when she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was\n",
        "nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the\n",
        "Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which\n",
        "mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank\n",
        "came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a\n",
        "traveller in wines. They got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest,\n",

        "\n",
        "“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in\n",
        "Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4½ per cent. Two thousand\n",
        "five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw so large\n",
        "a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no\n",
        "doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that\n",
        "a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand\n",
        "that as long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and\n",
        "so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of\n",
        "course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest\n",
        "every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do\n",
        "pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a\n",

        "whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and\n",

        "always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear,\n",
        "and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour\n",
        "from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they\n",

        "afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I\n",

        "to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the\n",

        "\n",
        "“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near King’s\n",

        "Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he\n",
        "put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which\n",
        "happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church\n",
        "first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step\n",
        "out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and\n",
        "looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not\n",

        "anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving\n",
        "me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got\n",
        "my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was\n",
        "very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of\n",
        "mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write?\n",
        "Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can’t sleep a wink at\n",

        "\n",
        "“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look,\n",

        "\n",
        "“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a\n",
        "feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn\n",
        "upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was\n",
        "brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at\n",
        "the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at\n",
        "the right forefinger. Her boots I didn’t observe. She had small round,\n",

        "really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed\n",
        "everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you\n",
        "have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my\n",
        "boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always\n",
        "at a woman’s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the\n",
        "knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her\n",
        "sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double\n",
        "line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against\n",
        "the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand\n",
        "type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side\n",
        "of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the\n",
        "broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing\n",
        "the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark\n",
        "upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It surprised me.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested\n",
        "on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was\n",
        "wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one\n",
        "having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was\n",
        "buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at\n",
        "the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady,\n",
        "otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots,\n",
        "half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a\n",
        "hurry.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my\n",
        "friend’s incisive reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home\n",
        "but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was\n",
        "torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove\n",
        "and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and\n",
        "dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark\n",
        "would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though\n",
        "rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you\n",
        "mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\n",
        "\n",
        "I held the little printed slip to the light. “Missing,” it said, “on\n",
        "the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About\n",
        "five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black\n",
        "hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and\n",
        "moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed,\n",
        "when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat,\n",
        "gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters\n",

        "\n",
        "“That will do,” said Holmes. “As to the letters,” he continued,\n",
        "glancing over them, “they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in\n",
        "them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one\n",
        "remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.”\n",

        "little ‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no\n",
        "superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The\n",
        "point about the signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it\n",

        "the young lady’s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could\n",
        "meet us here at six o’clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that\n",
        "we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can\n",

        "have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which\n",
        "he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to\n",
        "fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of\n",
        "Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to\n",
        "the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary\n",
        "circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would\n",
        "be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\n",
        "\n",
        "I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the\n",
        "conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that\n",
        "he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity\n",
        "of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\n",
        "\n",
        "A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at\n",

        "sufferer. It was not until close upon six o’clock that I found myself\n",
        "free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street,\n",
        "half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the _dénouement_ of\n",
        "the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half\n",
        "asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his\n",
        "armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the\n",
        "pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent\n",
        "his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\n",
        "\n",

        "“No, no, the mystery!” I cried.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There\n",
        "was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some\n",
        "of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no\n",

        "\n",

        "about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash\n",
        "linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she\n",
        "came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have\n",
        "noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind\n",
        "on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not\n",
        "connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a\n",
        "family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless\n",
        "expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?”\n",
        "\n",

        "quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more\n",
        "worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in\n",
        "this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some\n",
        "little slurring over of the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the\n",

        "crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I\n",

        "glancing about him like a rat in a trap.\n",

        "“Oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,” said Holmes suavely. “There is no\n",
        "possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent,\n",
        "and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible\n",
        "for me to solve so simple a question. That’s right! Sit down and let us\n",
        "talk it over.”\n",
        "\n",

        "of moisture on his brow. “It—it’s not actionable,” he stammered.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,\n",

        "position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It\n",
        "was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable\n",
        "disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it\n",
        "was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little\n",
        "income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her\n",
        "marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what\n",
        "does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of\n",
        "keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of\n",
        "her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She\n",
        "became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her\n",
        "positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever\n",
        "stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head\n",
        "than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he\n",
        "disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked\n",
        "the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear\n",
        "voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the\n",

        "instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman’s\n",
        "attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed\n",
        "admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was\n",
        "obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a\n",
        "real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an\n",
        "engagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from\n",
        "turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up\n",
        "forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The\n",
        "thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a\n",
        "dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the\n",
        "young lady’s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor\n",

        "his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen\n",
        "to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as\n",
        "he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick\n",
        "of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I\n",

        "tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as\n",
        "they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen,\n",
        "and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them\n",
        "had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the\n",

        "both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the\n",
        "race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a man\n",

        "few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr.\n",
        "James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the\n",
        "best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and\n",

        "game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded\n",

        "She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood\n",

        "to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using\n",
        "very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his\n",
        "hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their\n",

        "that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and\n",
        "that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said\n",
        "the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say\n",
        "that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help\n",
        "of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his\n",
        "hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with\n",
        "fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out\n",
        "upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated\n",
        "blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might\n",
        "very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which\n",
        "was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under\n",
        "these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict\n",
        "of ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he\n",
        "was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have\n",

        "must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave\n",
        "against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the\n",
        "culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and\n",

        "not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances\n",
        "were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own\n",
        "arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as\n",
        "highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural\n",
        "under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to\n",
        "a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as\n",
        "either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint\n",

        "much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was\n",

        "ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I\n",

        "pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still,\n",
        "of course, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.\n",

        "\n",

        "brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little\n",
        "of life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything\n",

        "time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by\n",
        "his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and\n",
        "deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal\n",
        "something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the\n",
        "weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest.\n",

        "the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been\n",

        "my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind.\n",
        "That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen\n",
        "quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go\n",
        "for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the\n",
        "blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes’ attention to\n",
        "it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could\n",
        "that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow\n",
        "does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an\n",
        "attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I\n",
        "cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the\n",
        "incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true\n",
        "the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his\n",
        "overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and\n",

        "death, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had\n",
        "then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight\n",

        "darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his\n",
        "eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was\n",
        "bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins\n",
        "stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed\n",
        "to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so\n",
        "absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or\n",
        "remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a\n",
        "quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way\n",
        "along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the\n",
        "woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that\n",
        "district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and\n",
        "amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes\n",
        "would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little\n",
        "detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective\n",
        "indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the\n",
        "interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions\n",
        "was directed towards a definite end.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some\n",
        "fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley\n",
        "Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods\n",
        "which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting\n",
        "pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner’s dwelling. On\n",
        "the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was\n",
        "a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of\n",
        "the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the\n",
        "exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was\n",
        "the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by\n",
        "the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager\n",
        "face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the\n",
        "trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and\n",
        "then turned upon my companion.\n",
        "\n",
        "“What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or\n",
        "other trace. But how on earth—”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward\n",
        "twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it\n",
        "vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I\n",
        "been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over\n",
        "it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have\n",
        "covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are\n",
        "three separate tracks of the same feet.” He drew out a lens and lay\n",
        "down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time\n",
        "rather to himself than to us. “These are young McCarthy’s feet. Twice\n",
        "he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply\n",
        "marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran\n",
        "when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father’s feet\n",
        "as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the\n",
        "gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here?\n",
        "Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go,\n",
        "they come again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they\n",
        "come from?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the\n",
        "track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the\n",
        "shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes\n",
        "traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon\n",
        "his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained\n",
        "there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what\n",
        "seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens\n",
        "not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could\n",
        "reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he\n",
        "carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the\n",
        "wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning\n",
        "to his natural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the right must\n",
        "be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and\n",
        "perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our\n",
        "luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”\n",
        "\n",
        "It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into\n",

        "in the wood.\n",
        "\n",
        "“This may interest you, Lestrade,” he remarked, holding it out. “The\n",
        "murder was done with it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I see no marks.”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“How do you know, then?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days.\n",
        "There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds\n",
        "with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And the murderer?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears\n",
        "thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses\n",
        "a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are\n",
        "several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our\n",

        "\n",

        "showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of\n",
        "character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping\n",
        "eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his\n",
        "appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the\n",
        "corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear\n",

        "jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it.\n",
        "Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save\n",

        "sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the\n",
        "road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under,\n",

        "\n",
        "“One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay\n",
        "in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us,\n",
        "so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the\n",
        "first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the\n",

        "spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as\n",
        "though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became\n",
        "wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected.\n",
        "There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a\n",
        "quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be\n",
        "in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to\n",
        "make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and\n",
        "though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when\n",
        "she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path\n",
        "as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and\n",

        "streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear\n",
        "should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the\n",
        "bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind\n",

        "have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that\n",

        "when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be\n",
        "in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He\n",
        "begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in\n",
        "his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and\n",
        "draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the\n",
        "servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was\n",

        "go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him\n",
        "in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a\n",

        "locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to\n",
        "enter. With a boy’s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I\n",

        "the table in front of the colonel’s plate. It was not a common thing\n",
        "for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money,\n",

        "without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off\n",
        "the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation\n",
        "grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the\n",
        "usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however.\n",
        "He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of\n",

        "no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by\n",
        "man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush\n",
        "tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man\n",
        "who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the\n",
        "roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold\n",

        "“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse\n",
        "your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken\n",
        "sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to\n",
        "search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay\n",
        "at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the\n",
        "water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his\n",
        "known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of ‘suicide.’ But I, who knew\n",
        "how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade\n",
        "myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,\n",
        "however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of\n",
        "some £ 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“One moment,” Holmes interposed, “your statement is, I foresee, one of\n",
        "the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date\n",

        "found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On\n",
        "the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K.\n",
        "K. repeated upon it, and ‘Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’\n",
        "written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers\n",

        "nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered\n",

        "of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go,\n",
        "for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away\n",
        "from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his\n",
        "absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at\n",
        "once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound\n",
        "in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull.\n",
        "I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his\n",
        "consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in\n",
        "the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit\n",
        "unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘death\n",
        "from accidental causes.’ Carefully as I examined every fact connected\n",
        "with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the\n",
        "idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no\n",

        "\n",
        "“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I\n",

        "happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed\n",
        "away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I\n",
        "had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow\n",

        "\n",
        "The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning\n",

        "on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small,\n",
        "unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular\n",

        "inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps,\n",
        "fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped\n",
        "destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us\n",

        "\n",
        "Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which\n",
        "showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It\n",
        "was headed, “March, 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical\n",

        "east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one\n",
        "day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But\n",
        "now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay\n",
        "there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison\n",
        "or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of\n",

        "such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were\n",

        "out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his\n",

        "the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice\n",
        "whispered, “Walk past me, and then look back at me.” The words fell\n",
        "quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come\n",
        "from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever,\n",
        "very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down\n",

        "regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my\n",
        "surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion\n",
        "to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round\n",

        "could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in\n",
        "one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his\n",

        "very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I\n",

        "shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing\n",

        "I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would\n",

        "for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to\n",
        "have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that\n",

        "murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair\n",

        "at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the\n",

        "avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax\n",

        "cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a\n",
        "piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy\n",

        "reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that\n",

        "of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the\n",
        "colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of\n",
        "mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply\n",

        "had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the\n",
        "premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the\n",
        "matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as\n",
        "he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated\n",
        "with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he\n",

        "incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his\n",
        "right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been\n",
        "cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there,\n",
        "adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the\n",
        "stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same\n",
        "source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair\n",
        "and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a\n",
        "mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair’s assertion that\n",
        "she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she\n",

        "that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a\n",
        "different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the\n",

        "throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not\n",
        "sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when\n",
        "the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard\n",
        "from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.\n",

        "the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure\n",
        "of the coat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same\n",

        "to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The\n",
        "pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the\n",

        "\n",
        "“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is\n",
        "as black as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he\n",

        "opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a\n",
        "whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “Here it is!” He\n",

        "\n",
        "We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face\n",
        "towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was\n",
        "a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a\n",
        "coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He\n",
        "was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which\n",
        "covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad\n",
        "wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its\n",
        "contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three\n",
        "teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red\n",
        "hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\n",
        "\n",
        "“He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.\n",
        "\n",
        "“He certainly needs a wash,” remarked Holmes. “I had an idea that he\n",
        "might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” He opened\n",
        "the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very\n",
        "large bath-sponge.\n",
        "\n",
        "“He! he! You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very\n",
        "quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “He doesn’t look a\n",
        "credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?” He slipped his key into the\n",
        "lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half\n",
        "turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes\n",
        "stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it\n",
        "twice vigorously across and down the prisoner’s face.\n",
        "\n",

        "in the county of Kent.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off\n",
        "under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown\n",
        "tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and\n",
        "the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A\n",
        "twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his\n",
        "bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and\n",
        "smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy\n",
        "bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a\n",
        "scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the missing man.\n",
        "I know him from the photograph.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself\n",
        "to his destiny. “Be it so,” said he. “And pray what am I charged with?”\n",

        "“With making away with Mr. Neville St.— Oh, come, you can’t be charged\n",
        "with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,” said the\n",
        "inspector with a grin. “Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the\n",
        "force, but this really takes the cake.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has\n",
        "been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“No crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said Holmes.\n",
        "“You would have done better to have trusted your wife.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It was not the wife; it was the children,” groaned the prisoner. “God\n",

        "exposure! What can I do?”\n",
        "\n",
        "Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly\n",
        "on the shoulder.\n",
        "\n",
        "“If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said he,\n",
        "“of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you\n",
        "convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against\n",
        "you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should\n",

        "\n",

        "reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to\n",
        "have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I\n",
        "volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my\n",
        "adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I\n",
        "could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I\n",
        "had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been\n",
        "famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my\n",
        "attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as\n",
        "possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by\n",
        "the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head\n",
        "of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business\n",

        "time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me\n",
        "for £ 25. I was at my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden\n",
        "idea came to me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked\n",
        "for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the\n",
        "City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the\n",

        "smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and\n",
        "sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but\n",
        "the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day\n",
        "in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly\n",
        "face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret.\n",
        "He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam\n",
        "Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the\n",
        "evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This\n",
        "fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew\n",

        "\n",
        "“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.\n",
        "I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £ 700\n",
        "a year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional\n",
        "advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of\n",
        "repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised\n",
        "character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver,\n",
        "poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take\n",
        "£ 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "“As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country,\n",
        "and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real\n",

        "her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms\n",
        "to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated\n",
        "him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice\n",
        "downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off\n",
        "my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and\n",
        "wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But\n",
        "then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and\n",
        "that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by\n",
        "my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the\n",
        "bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the\n",
        "coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in\n",
        "which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it\n",
        "disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but\n",
        "at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few\n",
        "minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of\n",
        "being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his\n",
        "murderer.\n",
        "\n",

        "determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my\n",
        "preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly\n",
        "anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a\n",
        "moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried\n",

        "making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he\n",
        "saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and\n",
        "carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the\n",
        "corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a\n",

        "which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his\n",
        "head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward\n",
        "to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at\n",
        "having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in\n",
        "uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and\n",
        "vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of\n",
        "Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of\n",
        "Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and\n",
        "also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a\n",
        "most unimpeachable Christmas goose.”\n",

        "left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘H. B.’ are legible\n",
        "upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers,\n",

        "hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but\n",
        "was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes\n",
        "had remarked, the initials “H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was\n",
        "pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For\n",
        "the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several\n",
        "places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the\n",
        "discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”\n",
        "\n",
        "He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion\n",
        "which was characteristic of him. “It is perhaps less suggestive than it\n",
        "might have been,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences\n",
        "which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a\n",
        "strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is\n",
        "of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly\n",
        "well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon\n",
        "evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing\n",
        "to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his\n",
        "fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at\n",
        "work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife\n",

        "\n",

        "goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has\n",
        "grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which\n",
        "he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are\n",
        "to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely\n",

        "\n",
        "“This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came\n",
        "in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of\n",
        "ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy\n",
        "so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he\n",
        "has assuredly gone down in the world.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and\n",
        "the moral retrogression?”\n",
        "\n",
        "Sherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he putting his\n",
        "finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. “They are\n",
        "never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a\n",
        "certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this\n",
        "precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the\n",
        "elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has\n",
        "less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a\n",
        "weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some\n",
        "of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign\n",
        "that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”\n",
        "\n",

        "be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining.\n",
        "The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the\n",
        "scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a\n",
        "distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the\n",
        "gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,\n",
        "showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the\n",
        "marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer\n",

        "touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended\n",
        "hand, recalled Holmes’ surmise as to his habits. His rusty black\n",

        "\n",

        "day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name,\n",
        "instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence\n",
        "every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were\n",
        "duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you,\n",
        "sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.”\n",

        "like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as\n",
        "we swung through the doctors’ quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street,\n",
        "and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an\n",

        "public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into\n",
        "Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two\n",

        "“Indeed! Whose, then?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.”\n",

        "“Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Breckinridge is his name.”\n",
        "\n",

        "prosperity to your house. Good-night.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Now for Mr. Breckinridge,” he continued, buttoning up his coat as we\n",
        "came out into the frosty air. “Remember, Watson that though we have so\n",
        "homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the\n",
        "other a man who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless\n",
        "we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but\n",
        "confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation\n",
        "which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has\n",
        "placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to\n",
        "the south, then, and quick march!”\n",
        "\n",
        "We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag\n",
        "of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the\n",
        "name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man,\n",
        "with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up\n",
        "the shutters.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Good-evening. It’s a cold night,” said Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Sold out of geese, I see,” continued Holmes, pointing at the bare\n",
        "slabs of marble.\n",

        "\n",

        "“Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?”\n",
        "\n",
        "To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the\n",
        "salesman.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Now, then, mister,” said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo,\n",
        "“what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight, now.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese\n",
        "which you supplied to the Alpha.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well then, I shan’t tell you. So now!”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know why you should\n",
        "be so warm over such a trifle.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I\n",
        "pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the\n",
        "business; but it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the\n",
        "geese to?’ and ‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they\n",
        "were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over\n",
        "them.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making\n",
        "inquiries,” said Holmes carelessly. “If you won’t tell us the bet is\n",
        "off, that is all. But I’m always ready to back my opinion on a matter\n",
        "of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country\n",
        "bred.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,” snapped the\n",

        "to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott\n",

        "which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the\n",
        "salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists\n",

        "\n",
        "A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. “Well then,” said\n",

        "\n",
        "“Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into\n",
        "the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you\n",
        "would wish to know.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with\n",
        "half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he\n",
        "is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into\n",
        "the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker\n",
        "Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin\n",
        "breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of\n",
        "his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Here we are!” said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. “The\n",
        "fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder.\n",
        "Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we\n",
        "settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what\n",
        "became of those geese?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, sir.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which\n",
        "you were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Ryder quivered with emotion. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “can you tell me\n",
        "where it went to?”\n",

        "“It came here.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Here?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don’t wonder that you\n",
        "should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead—the\n",
        "bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here\n",
        "in my museum.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his\n",
        "right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue\n",
        "carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant,\n",
        "many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain\n",
        "whether to claim or to disown it.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The game’s up, Ryder,” said Holmes quietly. “Hold up, man, or you’ll\n",
        "be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He’s not\n",
        "got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of\n",
        "brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to\n",
        "be sure!”\n",
        "\n",
        "For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought\n",
        "a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened\n",
        "eyes at his accuser.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could\n",
        "possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that\n",
        "little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had\n",
        "heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar’s?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,” said he in a crackling\n",
        "voice.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden\n",
        "wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for\n",
        "better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means\n",
        "you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very\n",
        "pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had\n",
        "been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would\n",
        "rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some\n",
        "small job in my lady’s room—you and your confederate Cusack—and you\n",
        "managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you\n",
        "rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man\n",
        "arrested. You then—”\n",
        "\n",
        "Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my\n",
        "companion’s knees. “For God’s sake, have mercy!” he shrieked. “Think of\n",
        "my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went\n",
        "wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I’ll swear it on a Bible.\n",
        "Oh, don’t bring it into court! For Christ’s sake, don’t!”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Get back into your chair!” said Holmes sternly. “It is very well to\n",
        "cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner\n",
        "in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge\n",

        "\n",
        "“Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of\n",
        "the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose\n",
        "into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope\n",
        "of safety.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. “I will tell you it just\n",
        "as it happened, sir,” said he. “When Horner had been arrested, it\n",
        "seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at\n",
        "once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it\n",
        "into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the\n",
        "hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and\n",
        "I made for my sister’s house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and\n",
        "lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the\n",
        "way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a\n",
        "detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring\n",
        "down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what\n",
        "was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been\n",
        "upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard\n",
        "and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just\n",
        "been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell\n",
        "into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what\n",
        "they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two\n",
        "things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where\n",
        "he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn\n",
        "the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the\n",
        "agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any\n",
        "moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my\n",
        "waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and\n",
        "looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and\n",
        "suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the\n",

        "good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my\n",
        "stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this\n",
        "I drove one of the birds—a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I\n",
        "caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat\n",
        "as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the\n",
        "stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature\n",
        "flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the\n",
        "matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered\n",

        "“‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all the same to you, I’d\n",

        "way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it\n",
        "was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and\n",
        "we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for\n",
        "there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake\n",

        "allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain\n",
        "was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the\n",
        "hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified\n",

        "wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my\n",

        "few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.\n",
        "As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved\n",

        "hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that\n",
        "of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that\n",
        "moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She\n",
        "writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully\n",
        "convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I\n",
        "bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never\n",
        "forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!’ There\n",
        "was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with\n",
        "her finger into the air in the direction of the Doctor’s room, but a\n",
        "fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling\n",
        "loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his\n",
        "dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious,\n",
        "and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid\n",
        "from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and\n",

        "\n",
        "“That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my\n",

        "\n",
        "“Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the\n",

        "coroner come to?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct\n",
        "had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any\n",
        "satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been\n",
        "fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by\n",
        "old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every\n",
        "night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite\n",
        "solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with\n",
        "the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large\n",
        "staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when\n",
        "she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon\n",

        "\n",
        "“Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately\n",

        "building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to\n",
        "move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very\n",
        "bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last\n",
        "night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly\n",
        "heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the\n",
        "herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was\n",
        "to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however,\n",
        "so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a\n",
        "dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead,\n",

        "The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our\n",
        "door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed\n",
        "himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the\n",
        "professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long\n",
        "frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in\n",
        "his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of\n",
        "the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to\n",
        "side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with\n",
        "the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the\n",
        "other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,\n",
        "fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird\n",
        "of prey.\n",

        "“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.\n",
        "\n",

        "traced her. What has she been saying to you?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is a little cold for the time of the year,” said Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old man furiously.\n",
        "\n",
        "“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my\n",
        "companion imperturbably.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Ha! You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step\n",
        "forward and shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I\n",
        "have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”\n",
        "\n",
        "My friend smiled.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Holmes, the busybody!”\n",
        "\n",

        "“Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!”\n",
        "\n",
        "Holmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversation is most entertaining,”\n",

        "draught.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I will go when I have had my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my\n",
        "affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a\n",
        "dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward,\n",
        "seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\n",
        "\n",
        "“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and hurling\n",
        "the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\n",
        "\n",
        "“He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughing. “I am not\n",
        "quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my\n",
        "grip was not much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up\n",
        "the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official\n",
        "detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,\n",
        "however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from\n",
        "her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we\n",
        "shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’\n",
        "Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this\n",
        "matter.”\n",
        "\n",
        "It was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his\n",
        "excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over\n",
        "with notes and figures.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “To determine its\n",
        "exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the\n",
        "investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the\n",
        "time of the wife’s death was little short of £ 1,100, is now, through\n",
        "the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £ 750. Each daughter can\n",
        "claim an income of £ 250, in case of marriage. It is evident,\n",
        "therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a\n",
        "mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very\n",
        "serious extent. My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it has\n",
        "proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way\n",
        "of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for\n",
        "dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting\n",
        "ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and\n",
        "drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your\n",
        "revolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument\n",
        "with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a\n",
        "tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.”\n",
        "\n",
        "At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,\n",
        "where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five\n",
        "miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a\n",
        "bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and\n",
        "wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the\n",
        "air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least\n",
        "there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring\n",
        "and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in\n",
        "the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his\n",
        "eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.\n",
        "Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed\n",
        "over the meadows.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Look there!” said he.\n",
        "\n",
        "A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into\n",
        "a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out\n",
        "the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Stoke Moran?” said he.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the\n",
        "driver.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that is where we\n",
        "are going.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs\n",
        "some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll\n",
        "find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the\n",
        "fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading his\n",
        "eyes. “Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”\n",
        "\n",
        "We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to\n",
        "Leatherhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I thought it as well,” said Holmes as we climbed the stile, “that this\n",
        "fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite\n",
        "business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see\n",
        "that we have been as good as our word.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face\n",
        "which spoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she\n",
        "cried, shaking hands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly.\n",
        "Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back\n",
        "before evening.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor’s acquaintance,” said\n",
        "Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss\n",
        "Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“So it appears.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will\n",
        "he say when he returns?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more\n",
        "cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him\n",
        "to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at\n",
        "Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us\n",
        "at once to the rooms which we are to examine.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central\n",
        "portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on\n",
        "each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked\n",
        "with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of\n",
        "ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the\n",
        "right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the\n",
        "windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that\n",
        "this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected\n",
        "against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but\n",
        "there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes\n",
        "walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep\n",
        "attention the outsides of the windows.\n",
        "\n",
        "“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the\n",
        "centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to\n",
        "Dr. Roylott’s chamber?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not\n",
        "seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my\n",
        "room.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing\n",
        "runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows\n",
        "in it, of course?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable\n",
        "from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room\n",
        "and bar your shutters?”\n",
        "\n",
        "Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the\n",
        "open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but\n",
        "without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be\n",
        "passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but\n",
        "they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!”\n",
        "said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly\n",
        "presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they\n",
        "were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the\n",
        "matter.”\n",
        "\n",
        "A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the\n",
        "three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so\n",
        "we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now\n",
        "sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a\n",
        "homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after\n",
        "the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in\n",
        "one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a\n",
        "dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles,\n",
        "with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the\n",
        "room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round\n",
        "and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old\n",
        "and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of\n",
        "the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,\n",
        "while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in\n",
        "every detail of the apartment.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointing to a\n",
        "thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually\n",
        "lying upon the pillow.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It goes to the housekeeper’s room.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It looks newer than the other things?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we\n",
        "wanted for ourselves.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You\n",
        "will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this\n",
        "floor.” He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand\n",
        "and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks\n",
        "between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which\n",
        "the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent\n",
        "some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.\n",
        "Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Won’t it ring?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You\n",
        "can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little\n",
        "opening for the ventilator is.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There are one or\n",
        "two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a\n",
        "builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the\n",
        "same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That is also quite modern,” said the lady.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy\n",
        "bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your\n",
        "permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the\n",
        "inner apartment.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his\n",
        "step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden\n",
        "shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair\n",
        "beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,\n",
        "and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.\n",
        "Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the\n",
        "keenest interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "“What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.\n",
        "\n",
        "“My stepfather’s business papers.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“No. What a strange idea!”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on\n",
        "the top of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a\n",
        "saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay.\n",
        "There is one point which I should wish to determine.” He squatted down\n",
        "in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the\n",
        "greatest attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his\n",
        "lens in his pocket. “Hullo! Here is something interesting!”\n",
        "\n",
        "The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one\n",
        "corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied\n",
        "so as to make a loop of whipcord.\n",
        "\n",
        "“What do you make of that, Watson?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be tied.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world, and\n",
        "when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I\n",
        "think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your\n",
        "permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was\n",
        "when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked\n",
        "several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself\n",
        "liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his\n",
        "reverie.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you should\n",
        "absolutely follow my advice in every respect.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I shall most certainly do so.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend\n",
        "upon your compliance.”\n",

        "\n",
        "Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village\n",
        "inn over there?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, that is the Crown.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Certainly.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,\n",
        "when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the\n",
        "night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put\n",
        "your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with\n",

        "window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed\n",
        "to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass\n",

        "Holmes’ example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the\n",
        "bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp\n",
        "onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had\n",
        "seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of\n",
        "his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that\n",
        "I could do to distinguish the words:\n",
        "\n",
        "“The least sound would be fatal to our plans.”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "I nodded again.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol\n",
        "ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and\n",
        "you in that chair.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\n",
        "\n",
        "Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed\n",
        "beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.\n",
        "Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\n",
        "\n",
        "How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound,\n",
        "not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat\n",
        "open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous\n",
        "tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of\n",
        "light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\n",
        "\n",
        "From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our\n",
        "very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah\n",
        "was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the\n",
        "parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they\n",
        "seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and\n",
        "still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction\n",
        "of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a\n",
        "strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room\n",
        "had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then\n",
        "all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an\n",
        "hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became\n",
        "audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of\n",
        "steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,\n",
        "Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with\n",
        "his cane at the bell-pull.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”\n",
        "\n",
        "But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a\n",
        "low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes\n",
        "made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed\n",
        "so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and\n",
        "filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing\n",
        "up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the\n",
        "night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled\n",
        "up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all\n",
        "mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the\n",
        "village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the\n",
        "sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood\n",
        "gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died\n",
        "away into the silence from which it rose.\n",
        "\n",
        "“What can it mean?” I gasped.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered. “And perhaps, after\n",
        "all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.\n",
        "Roylott’s room.”\n",
        "\n",
        "With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.\n",
        "Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then\n",
        "he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked\n",
        "pistol in my hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a\n",
        "dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of\n",
        "light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this\n",
        "table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long\n",
        "grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet\n",
        "thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short\n",
        "stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin\n",
        "was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at\n",
        "the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow\n",
        "band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round\n",
        "his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to\n",
        "move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat\n",
        "diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India. He\n",
        "has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,\n",
        "recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he\n",
        "digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we\n",
        "can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county\n",
        "police know what has happened.”\n",
        "\n",
        "As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and\n",
        "throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid\n",
        "perch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,\n",
        "which he closed upon it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke\n",
        "Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has\n",
        "already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news\n",
        "to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the\n",
        "care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official\n",
        "inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while\n",
        "indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet\n",
        "to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled\n",
        "back next day.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which\n",
        "shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from\n",
        "insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word\n",
        "‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the\n",
        "appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of\n",
        "her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I\n",
        "can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position\n",
        "when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an\n",
        "occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.\n",
        "My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to\n",
        "this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The\n",
        "discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the\n",
        "floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as\n",
        "a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.\n",
        "The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it\n",
        "with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of\n",
        "creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track.\n",
        "The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be\n",
        "discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a\n",
        "clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity\n",
        "with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point\n",
        "of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who\n",
        "could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where\n",
        "the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of\n",
        "course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to\n",
        "the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we\n",
        "saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this\n",
        "ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it\n",
        "would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not\n",
        "bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but\n",
        "sooner or later she must fall a victim.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An\n",
        "inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of\n",
        "standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he\n",
        "should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,\n",
        "and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which\n",
        "may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was\n",
        "obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe\n",
        "upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the\n",
        "steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the\n",
        "creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit\n",

        "I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table.\n",
        "He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap\n",
        "which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a\n",
        "handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He\n",

        "morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a\n",
        "doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a\n",

        "and abode of my morning visitor. “I regret that I have kept you\n",
        "waiting,” said I, sitting down in my library-chair. “You are fresh from\n",

        "occupation.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,” said he, and laughed. He\n",

        "outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is\n",
        "over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and\n",
        "pale-looking.\n",

        "“I have been making a fool of myself,” he gasped.\n",
        "\n",

        "been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.\n",
        "\n",

        "in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance\n",
        "upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of\n",

        "absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings\n",
        "amount to £ 27 10_s_. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in\n",

        "drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation\n",
        "seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was\n",

        "fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price\n",
        "upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to\n",
        "other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had\n",
        "made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his\n",
        "explanation of the fuller’s-earth was sufficient to explain the\n",
        "necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I\n",
        "should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the\n",
        "winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off,\n",
        "having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\n",
        "\n",
        "“At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.\n",
        "However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the\n",
        "little dim-lit station after eleven o’clock. I was the only passenger\n",
        "who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single\n",
        "sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate,\n",
        "however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow\n",
        "upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me\n",
        "into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the\n",
        "windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as\n",
        "fast as the horse could go.”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "“Did you observe the colour?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the\n",
        "carriage. It was a chestnut.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Tired-looking or fresh?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, fresh and glossy.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most\n",
        "interesting statement.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander\n",
        "Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from\n",
        "the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it\n",
        "must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the\n",
        "time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction,\n",
        "that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem\n",
        "to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and\n",
        "jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of\n",
        "where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make\n",
        "out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and\n",
        "then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but\n",
        "the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon\n",
        "flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for\n",
        "the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a\n",
        "stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him,\n",
        "pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped,\n",
        "as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I\n",
        "failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The\n",
        "instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily\n",
        "behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage\n",
        "drove away.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about\n",
        "looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door\n",
        "opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light\n",
        "shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a\n",
        "lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face\n",
        "forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from\n",
        "the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it\n",
        "was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a\n",
        "tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a\n",
        "gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from\n",
        "her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear,\n",
        "and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he\n",
        "walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few\n",
        "minutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little,\n",
        "plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which\n",
        "several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp\n",
        "on the top of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep you\n",
        "waiting an instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of\n",
        "German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the\n",
        "others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window,\n",
        "hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak\n",
        "shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully\n",
        "silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the\n",
        "passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of\n",
        "uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and\n",
        "what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And\n",
        "where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I\n",
        "knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that\n",
        "matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that\n",
        "radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was\n",
        "quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the\n",
        "country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath\n",
        "to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my\n",
        "fifty-guinea fee.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter\n",
        "stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was\n",
        "standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the\n",
        "yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I\n",
        "could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a\n",
        "chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be\n",
        "silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her\n",
        "eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom\n",
        "behind her.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak\n",
        "calmly; ‘I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you\n",
        "to do.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot\n",
        "possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on. ‘You can pass\n",
        "through the door; no one hinders.’ And then, seeing that I smiled and\n",
        "shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step\n",
        "forward, with her hands wrung together. ‘For the love of Heaven!’ she\n",
        "whispered, ‘get away from here before it is too late!’\n",
        "\n",
        "“But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage\n",
        "in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my\n",
        "fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night\n",
        "which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should\n",
        "I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the\n",
        "payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a\n",
        "monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had\n",
        "shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and\n",
        "declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew\n",
        "her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several\n",
        "footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw\n",
        "up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as\n",
        "noiselessly as she had come.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a\n",
        "chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was\n",
        "introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel. ‘By the way, I\n",
        "was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear\n",
        "that you have felt the draught.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door myself because I felt\n",
        "the room to be a little close.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. ‘Perhaps we had better\n",
        "proceed to business, then,’ said he. ‘Mr. Ferguson and I will take you\n",
        "up to see the machine.’\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“‘No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All\n",
        "we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is\n",
        "wrong with it.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat\n",
        "manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with\n",
        "corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors,\n",
        "the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had\n",
        "crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above\n",
        "the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the\n",
        "damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put\n",
        "on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the\n",
        "warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen\n",
        "eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent\n",
        "man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least\n",
        "a fellow-countryman.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he\n",
        "unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us\n",
        "could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the\n",
        "colonel ushered me in.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it\n",
        "would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn\n",
        "it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the\n",
        "descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon\n",
        "this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside\n",
        "which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the\n",
        "manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but\n",
        "there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little\n",
        "of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to\n",
        "show us how we can set it right.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.\n",
        "It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous\n",
        "pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers\n",
        "which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there\n",
        "was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through\n",
        "one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the\n",
        "india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk\n",
        "so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was\n",
        "clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my\n",
        "companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several\n",
        "practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When\n",
        "I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the\n",
        "machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was\n",
        "obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest\n",
        "fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an\n",
        "engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of\n",
        "wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came\n",
        "to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I\n",
        "had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I\n",
        "heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of\n",
        "the colonel looking down at me.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that\n",
        "which he had told me. ‘I was admiring your fuller’s-earth,’ said I; ‘I\n",
        "think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if\n",
        "I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my\n",
        "speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey\n",
        "eyes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.’ He took\n",
        "a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the\n",
        "lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite\n",
        "secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. ‘Hullo!’\n",
        "I yelled. ‘Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!’\n",
        "\n",
        "“And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart\n",
        "into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the\n",
        "leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood\n",
        "upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its\n",
        "light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly,\n",
        "jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must\n",
        "within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself,\n",
        "screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I\n",
        "implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the\n",
        "levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my\n",
        "head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.\n",
        "Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend\n",
        "very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the\n",
        "weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that\n",
        "dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve\n",
        "to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?\n",
        "Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which\n",
        "brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls\n",
        "were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line\n",
        "of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and\n",
        "broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could\n",
        "hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.\n",
        "The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the\n",
        "other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the\n",
        "lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal,\n",
        "told me how narrow had been my escape.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I\n",
        "found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a\n",
        "woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held\n",
        "a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had\n",
        "so foolishly rejected.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly. ‘They will be here in a moment.\n",
        "They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious\n",
        "time, but come!’\n",
        "\n",
        "“This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my\n",
        "feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The\n",
        "latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard\n",
        "the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering\n",
        "the other from the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath. My\n",
        "guide stopped and looked about her like one  who is at her wit’s end.\n",
        "Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window\n",
        "of which the moon was shining brightly.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high, but it may be that\n",
        "you can jump it.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the\n",
        "passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing\n",
        "forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s\n",
        "cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the\n",
        "window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden\n",
        "looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet\n",
        "down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I\n",
        "should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who\n",
        "pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to\n",
        "go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my\n",
        "mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw\n",
        "her arms round him and tried to hold him back.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘remember your promise after the\n",
        "last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he\n",
        "will be silent!’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break away from her.\n",
        "‘You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!’\n",
        "He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with\n",
        "his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to\n",
        "the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip\n",
        "loosened, and I fell into the garden below.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and\n",
        "rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood\n",
        "that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I\n",
        "ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my\n",
        "hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw\n",
        "that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my\n",
        "wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a\n",
        "sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among\n",
        "the rose-bushes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a\n",
        "very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was\n",
        "breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew,\n",
        "and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The\n",
        "smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night’s\n",
        "adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly\n",

        "a circle with Eyford for its centre.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There you are,” said he. “That circle is drawn at a radius of ten\n",

        "\n",
        "“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should have spared you\n",

        "\n",
        "“Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse\n",

        "\n",

        "“Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large scale, and\n",

        "had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old\n",

        "them right enough.”\n",
        "\n",
        "But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined\n",
        "to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we\n",
        "saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small\n",
        "clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich\n",
        "feather over the landscape.\n",

        "\n",
        "“I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and\n",

        "\n",
        "“Tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is Dr. Becher a German, very thin,\n",
        "with a long, sharp nose?”\n",
        "\n",
        "The station-master laughed heartily. “No, sir, Dr. Becher is an\n",
        "Englishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined\n",
        "waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I\n",
        "understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good\n",
        "Berkshire beef would do him no harm.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all\n",
        "hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and\n",
        "there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us,\n",
        "spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front\n",
        "three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.\n",
        "\n",
        "“That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. “There is the\n",
        "gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second\n",
        "window is the one that I jumped from.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge upon them.\n",
        "There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was\n",
        "crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt\n",
        "they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.\n",

        "though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.”\n",

        "a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving\n",
        "rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the\n",
        "fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes’ ingenuity failed ever to\n",
        "discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.\n",
        "\n",
        "The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which\n",
        "they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed\n",
        "human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset,\n",
        "however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the\n",
        "flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been\n",
        "reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and\n",
        "iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our\n",
        "unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin\n",
        "were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found,\n",
        "which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have\n",
        "been already referred to.\n",
        "\n",
        "How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the\n",
        "spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a\n",
        "mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain\n",
        "tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom\n",
        "had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the\n",
        "whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold\n",
        "or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear\n",
        "the unconscious man out of the way of danger.\n",
        "\n",

        "the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever\n",
        "been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his\n",
        "general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight\n",
        "forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair,\n",
        "too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the\n",
        "edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the\n",
        "verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white\n",
        "waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured\n",

        "in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by\n",

        "into the pew. There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew\n",
        "handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for\n",
        "the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me\n",

        "ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but\n",
        "you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but\n",
        "exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me\n",
        "dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to\n",
        "tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly\n",
        "was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came\n",
        "to Mr. Doran’s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push\n",
        "her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even\n",
        "threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the\n",
        "sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon\n",

        "astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out\n",
        "upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of\n",
        "cold woodcock, a pheasant, a _pâté de foie gras_ pie with a group of\n",
        "ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my\n",

        "taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he\n",
        "still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution,\n",
        "perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\n",

        "just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part,\n",
        "I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.” He was\n",
        "a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert\n",
        "manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady. “Frank here and I\n",
        "met in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a\n",
        "claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day\n",
        "father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had\n",
        "a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the\n",
        "poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting\n",
        "any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco. Frank wouldn’t throw up his\n",
        "hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing\n",
        "anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just\n",
        "fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his\n",
        "pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa.\n",
        "So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged\n",
        "myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be\n",
        "married right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of you;\n",
        "and I won’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we\n",
        "talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman\n",
        "all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank\n",
        "went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went\n",
        "prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After\n",
        "that came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been\n",
        "attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the\n",
        "killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa\n",
        "thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in ’Frisco. Not\n",
        "a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that\n",
        "Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to ’Frisco, and we came\n",
        "to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I\n",
        "felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place\n",
        "in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my\n",
        "duty by him. We can’t command our love, but we can our actions. I went\n",
        "to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a\n",
        "wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just\n",
        "as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and\n",
        "looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at\n",
        "first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of\n",
        "question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to\n",
        "see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was turning\n",
        "round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee\n",
        "in my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make\n",
        "a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know\n",
        "what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to\n",
        "be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that\n",
        "he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped\n",
        "my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he\n",
        "returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when\n",
        "he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment\n",
        "that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever\n",
        "he might direct.\n",
        "\n",
        "“When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and\n",

        "Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all\n",
        "those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain\n",
        "afterwards. I hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank\n",
        "out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and\n",
        "then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and\n",
        "followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St.\n",
        "Simon to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little\n",

        "like to vanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line\n",

        "to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums\n",
        "of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club,\n",
        "and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a\n",
        "number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play\n",
        "heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again\n",
        "and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his\n",
        "allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than\n",
        "once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but\n",
        "each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough\n",
        "to draw him back again.\n",
        "\n",
        "“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell\n",

        "my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the\n",
        "fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world\n",
        "to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a\n",
        "brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think\n",
        "of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am\n",
        "convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in\n",

        "a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and\n",
        "housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be.\n",
        "She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In\n",
        "only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has\n",
        "asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she\n",
        "has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the\n",
        "right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have\n",

        "mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in\n",
        "the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had\n",

        "my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of\n",

        "the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending\n",
        "it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and\n",
        "turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the\n",

        "the coronet and of Arthur’s face, she read the whole story and, with a\n",
        "scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the\n",
        "police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the\n",
        "inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood\n",
        "sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to\n",
        "charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private\n",
        "matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was\n",
        "national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in\n",
        "everything.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me arrested at once. It would\n",

        "five minutes.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have\n",
        "stolen,’ said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I\n",
        "was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that\n",
        "of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened\n",
        "to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it\n",
        "all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing\n",
        "stones.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘You may as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been caught in\n",

        "but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the\n",
        "beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning\n",
        "away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words\n",
        "of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the\n",
        "inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only\n",
        "of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where\n",
        "he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could\n",
        "be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our\n",
        "persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and\n",
        "I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round\n",
        "to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The\n",
        "police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of\n",
        "it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already\n",
        "offered a reward of £ 1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my\n",
        "honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!”\n",
        "\n",
        "He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro,\n",
        "droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.\n",

        "\n",
        "“Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His\n",
        "silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular\n",
        "points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which\n",
        "awoke you from your sleep?”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as\n",
        "to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of\n",
        "these gems?”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“Now, my dear sir,” said Holmes, “is it not obvious to you now that\n",
        "this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the\n",
        "police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a\n",
        "simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is\n",
        "involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his\n",
        "bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau,\n",
        "took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it,\n",
        "went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the\n",
        "thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then\n",
        "returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed\n",
        "himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is\n",
        "such a theory tenable?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But what other is there?” cried the banker with a gesture of despair.\n",
        "“If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is our task to find that out,” replied Holmes; “so now, if you\n",
        "please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote\n",
        "an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.”\n",
        "\n",
        "My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which\n",
        "I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply\n",
        "stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt\n",
        "of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his\n",
        "unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes’ judgment that I\n",
        "felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was\n",
        "dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the\n",
        "whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his\n",
        "breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.\n",
        "Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of\n",
        "hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a\n",
        "desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway\n",
        "journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence\n",
        "of the great financier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a\n",
        "little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,\n",
        "stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the\n",
        "entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into\n",
        "a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the\n",
        "kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a\n",
        "lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at\n",
        "all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us\n",
        "standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the\n",
        "front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind\n",
        "into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into\n",
        "the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were\n",
        "sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.\n",
        "She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,\n",
        "which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do\n",
        "not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face.\n",
        "Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.\n",
        "As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater\n",
        "sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the\n",
        "more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,\n",
        "with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she\n",
        "went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a\n",
        "sweet womanly caress.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,\n",

        "\n",
        "He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the\n",
        "large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he\n",
        "opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his\n",

        "\n",
        "The banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with\n",

        "wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a\n",
        "look at it.” He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it\n",
        "upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art,\n",
        "and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one\n",
        "side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three\n",

        "to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other\n",
        "topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three\n",
        "when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his\n",
        "chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer.\n",
        "With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and\n",
        "his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I think that this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass above\n",

        "fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may\n",
        "be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I\n",
        "hope that I may be back in a few hours.” He cut a slice of beef from\n",
        "the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of\n",
        "bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon\n",
        "his expedition.\n",
        "\n",
        "I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent\n",
        "spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it\n",

        "“Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since\n",
        "I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet\n",
        "little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.\n",

        "\n",
        "I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction\n",
        "than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even\n",
        "a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a\n",
        "few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that\n",
        "he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.\n",
        "\n",
        "I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I\n",
        "retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for\n",
        "days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his\n",
        "lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in,\n",
        "but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a\n",

        "\n",
        "It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change\n",

        "and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed\n",
        "to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy\n",

        "him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one\n",
        "side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle,\n",
        "your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something\n",
        "suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his\n",
        "hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had\n",
        "just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was\n",
        "endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Is it possible?” gasped the banker.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he\n",

        "true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved\n",
        "little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous\n",

        "asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted\n",
        "to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How\n",
        "cruelly I have misjudged him!”\n",
        "\n",
        "“When I arrived at the house,” continued Holmes, “I at once went very\n",
        "carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow\n",
        "which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening\n",
        "before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve\n",
        "impressions. I passed along the tradesmen’s path, but found it all\n",
        "trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the\n",
        "far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,\n",
        "whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I\n",
        "could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run\n",
        "back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel\n",
        "marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I\n",
        "thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of\n",
        "whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I\n",
        "passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random\n",
        "tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable\n",
        "lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of\n",
        "me.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\n",
        "line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was\n",
        "at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your\n",
        "son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and\n",
        "as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it\n",
        "was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and\n",
        "found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow\n",
        "away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred\n",
        "yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where\n",
        "the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally,\n",
        "where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not\n",
        "mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge\n",
        "of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the\n",
        "highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared,\n",
        "so there was an end to that clue.\n",
        "\n",
        "“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill\n",
        "and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see\n",
        "that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an\n",
        "instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then\n",
        "beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man\n",
        "had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed\n",
        "had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled\n",
        "with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength\n",
        "causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had\n",
        "returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his\n",
        "opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and\n",

        "allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible\n",
        "reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent\n",
        "explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret\n",
        "was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that\n",

        "her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered\n",
        "continually from one to the other, noting every little want and\n",
        "forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff,\n",
        "boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.\n",
        "And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost\n",
        "in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I\n",
        "have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the\n",
        "disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never\n",
        "met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is\n",
        "small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.\n",
        "His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage\n",
        "fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any\n",
        "creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and\n",
        "he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice,\n",
        "little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the\n",
        "creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.”\n",

        "“I am glad of all details,” remarked my friend, “whether they seem to\n",
        "you to be relevant or not.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant\n",
        "thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and\n",
        "conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife.\n",
        "Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled\n",
        "hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have\n",
        "been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to\n",
        "take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a\n",
        "sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a\n",
        "most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the\n",
        "nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of\n",
        "the building.\n",
        "\n",
        "“For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very\n",
        "quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and\n",
        "whispered something to her husband.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Oh, yes,’ said he, turning to me, ‘we are very much obliged to you,\n",
        "Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair.\n",
        "I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your\n",
        "appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become\n",
        "you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you\n",
        "would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of\n",
        "blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore\n",
        "unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a\n",
        "better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle\n",
        "expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated\n",
        "in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which\n",
        "is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house,\n",
        "with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been\n",
        "placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In\n",
        "this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on\n",
        "the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest\n",
        "stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he\n",
        "was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who\n",
        "has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with\n",
        "her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an\n",
        "hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence\n",
        "the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to\n",
        "little Edward in the nursery.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly\n",
        "similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the\n",
        "window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which\n",
        "my employer had an immense _répertoire_, and which he told inimitably.\n",
        "Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little\n",
        "sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me\n",
        "to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the\n",
        "heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he\n",
        "ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what\n",
        "the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They\n",
        "were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the\n",
        "window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going\n",
        "on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon\n",
        "devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought\n",
        "seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On\n",
        "the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief\n",
        "up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that\n",
        "there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was\n",
        "nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance,\n",
        "however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton\n",
        "Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in\n",
        "my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually\n",
        "people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which\n",
        "bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my\n",
        "handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon\n",
        "me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced\n",
        "that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what\n",
        "was behind me. She rose at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road\n",
        "there who stares up at Miss Hunter.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘No, I know no one in these parts.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to\n",
        "go away.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round\n",
        "and wave him away like that.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down\n",
        "the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again\n",
        "in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the\n",
        "road.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Pray continue,” said Holmes. “Your narrative promises to be a most\n",
        "interesting one.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to\n",
        "be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On\n",
        "the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took\n",
        "me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we\n",
        "approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as\n",
        "of a large animal moving about.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Look in here!’ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two\n",
        "planks. ‘Is he not a beauty?’\n",
        "\n",
        "“I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague\n",
        "figure huddled up in the darkness.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer, laughing at the start which I\n",
        "had given. ‘It’s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really\n",
        "old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We\n",
        "feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as\n",
        "keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the\n",
        "trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness’ sake don’t you\n",
        "ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it’s\n",
        "as much as your life is worth.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look\n",
        "out of my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a\n",
        "beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was\n",
        "silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the\n",
        "peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was\n",
        "moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the\n",
        "moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf,\n",
        "tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting\n",
        "bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow\n",
        "upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart\n",
        "which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\n",
        "\n",
        "“And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you\n",
        "know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at\n",
        "the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I\n",
        "began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by\n",
        "rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in\n",
        "the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I\n",
        "had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack\n",
        "away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer.\n",
        "It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I\n",
        "took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key\n",
        "fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one\n",
        "thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It\n",
        "was my coil of hair.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and\n",
        "the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded\n",
        "itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With\n",
        "trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew\n",
        "from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I\n",
        "assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle\n",
        "as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned\n",
        "the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the\n",
        "Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a\n",
        "drawer which they had locked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I\n",
        "soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was\n",
        "one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door\n",
        "which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into\n",
        "this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I\n",
        "ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door,\n",
        "his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very\n",
        "different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His\n",
        "cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins\n",
        "stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried\n",
        "past me without a word or a look.\n",
        "\n",
        "“This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the\n",
        "grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could\n",
        "see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a\n",
        "row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered\n",
        "up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down,\n",
        "glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as\n",
        "merry and jovial as ever.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I passed you without a\n",
        "word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I, ‘you seem\n",
        "to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the\n",
        "shutters up.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my\n",
        "remark.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I have made my dark room\n",
        "up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.\n",
        "Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?’ He spoke\n",
        "in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at\n",
        "me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was\n",
        "something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all\n",
        "on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my\n",
        "share of that. It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good\n",
        "might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s\n",
        "instinct; perhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling.\n",
        "At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any\n",
        "chance to pass the forbidden door.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,\n",
        "besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in\n",
        "these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen\n",
        "bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and\n",
        "yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was\n",
        "the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there.\n",
        "Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with\n",
        "them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently\n",
        "in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,\n",
        "which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner\n",
        "were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.\n",
        "They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows\n",
        "in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening\n",
        "light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and\n",
        "across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an\n",
        "iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at\n",
        "the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the\n",
        "key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the\n",
        "shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from\n",
        "beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a\n",
        "skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage\n",
        "gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I\n",
        "suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass\n",
        "backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone\n",
        "out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the\n",
        "sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I\n",
        "turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me\n",
        "clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through\n",
        "the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting\n",
        "outside.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I thought that it must be\n",
        "when I saw the door open.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Oh, I am so frightened!’ I panted.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you cannot think how\n",
        "caressing and soothing his manner was—‘and what has frightened you, my\n",
        "dear young lady?’\n",
        "\n",
        "“But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was\n",
        "keenly on my guard against him.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I answered. ‘But it\n",
        "is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran\n",
        "out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘I am sure that I do not know.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?’ He\n",
        "was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘I am sure if I had known—’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that\n",
        "threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of\n",
        "rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—‘I’ll throw you\n",
        "to the mastiff.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I\n",
        "must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I\n",
        "found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you,\n",
        "Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was\n",
        "frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants,\n",
        "even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring\n",
        "you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house,\n",
        "but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon\n",
        "made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down\n",
        "to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then\n",
        "returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind\n",
        "as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered\n",
        "that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that\n",
        "evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had\n",
        "any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him\n",
        "free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at\n",
        "the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come\n",
        "into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock,\n",
        "for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all\n",
        "the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you\n",
        "all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could\n",
        "tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My\n",
        "friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his\n",
        "pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Is Toller still drunk?” he asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing\n",

        "is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate\n",

        "\n",
        "“Better close the front door,” cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the\n",
        "stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the\n",
        "baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying\n",
        "sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red\n",
        "face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.\n",
        "\n",
        "“My God!” he cried. “Someone has loosed the dog. It’s not been fed for\n",
        "two days. Quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!”\n",
        "\n",
        "Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller\n",
        "hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle\n",
        "buried in Rucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the\n",
        "ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its\n",
        "keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With\n",
        "much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly\n",
        "mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and\n",
        "having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I\n",
        "did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him\n",
        "when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Mrs. Toller!” cried Miss Hunter.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up\n",
        "to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were\n",
        "planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Ha!” said Holmes, looking keenly at her. “It is clear that Mrs. Toller\n",
        "knows more about this matter than anyone else.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points\n",
        "on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and I’d have done so\n",
        "before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If there’s\n",
        "police-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was the one\n",
        "that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice’s friend too.\n",
        "\n",
        "“She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn’t, from the time that her\n",
        "father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything,\n",
        "but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler\n",
        "at a friend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of\n",
        "her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she\n",
        "never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle’s\n",
        "hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a\n",
        "husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give\n",
        "him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her\n",
        "to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her\n",
        "money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got\n",
        "brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s door. Then she got better\n",
        "at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but\n",
        "that didn’t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as\n",
        "true as man could be.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good enough to tell\n",
        "us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that\n",
        "remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of\n",
        "imprisonment?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, sir.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the\n",
        "disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That was it, sir.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,\n",
        "blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,\n",
        "metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the\n",
        "same as his.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said Mrs.\n",
        "Toller serenely.\n",
        "\n",
        "“And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of\n",
        "drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master\n",
        "had gone out.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You have it, sir, just as it happened.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes, “for you\n",
        "have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes\n",
        "the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had\n",
        "best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our\n",
        "_locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one.”\n",
        "\n",

        "of the _encyclopædia_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker\n",

        "as they were at. it must, then, be something out of the house. what\n",

        "windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that\n",

        "passed to raise the bar. then with his lens he tested the hinges, but\n",

        "homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after\n",
        "the fashion of old country-houses. a brown chest of drawers stood in\n",
        "one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a\n",
        "dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. these articles,\n",
        "with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the\n",
        "room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre. the boards round\n",
        "and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old\n",
        "and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of\n",
        "the house. holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,\n",
        "while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in\n",
        "every detail of the apartment.\n",
        "\n",
        "“where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointing to a\n",
        "thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually\n",
        "lying upon the pillow.\n",
        "\n",
        "“it goes to the housekeeper’s room.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“it looks newer than the other things?”\n",

        "will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this\n",
        "floor.” he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand\n",
        "and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks\n",
        "between the boards. then he did the same with the wood-work with which\n",
        "the chamber was panelled. finally he walked over to the bed and spent\n",
        "some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.\n",
        "finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\n",

        "“won’t it ring?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“no, it is not even attached to a wire. this is very interesting. you\n",

        "\n",
        "“how very absurd! i never noticed that before.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“very strange!” muttered holmes, pulling at the rope. “there are one or\n",
        "two very singular points about this room. for example, what a fool a\n",
        "builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the\n",
        "same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”\n",
        "\n",

        "“done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.”\n",
